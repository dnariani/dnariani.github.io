            <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Good Reads</a></h3>
            <p>A book recommendation site has an unappealing layout, and navigation takes long.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong>Colors are very minimal.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The consistency is not there as the clustering and font makes it feel complicated.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The grid layout is not too spaced.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong>Content is spaced but seems to close.</li>
